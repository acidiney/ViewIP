# ViewIP

*This class allows to discover any ip in the request and the location of this ip.*


The idea is to translate this function into other languages ​​to make it easier for beginner and professional programmers to solve their errors or implement in possible projects

## PHP

In this class we have two methods statics:
1. Request::Ip() -> To get ip in request
2. Request::Location($ip) -> To get the location about param ip ... This method return a array to details.
